## How it works

Explain how your project works

The digital lock uses 4 button inputs. 4 combinations are allowed. If the incorrect one is used, the seven segment display says 'err' and the last led will be on, otherwise it will say 'open' and all of the leds will be on. Usign the rstn button, the lock is reset and can take in another combination.
